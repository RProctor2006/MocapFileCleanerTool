# MocapFileCleanerTool
This is a tool I am making that will take an fbx file of a motion capture animation and delete cameras and unlabelled markers to help clean-up the file and get it ready for engine. You will also be able to edit the skeleton name and un-label markers.

You can download the application from here:
